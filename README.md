## Reference manager (Zotero/Zotfile/Dropbox)
Using [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) with [ZotFile](http://zotfile.com/). Keeping synchronized across devices through Dropbox following [these instructions](http://islamicate-dh.github.io/2016-05-27-set-up-zotero-between-multiple-computers/). Basically, by using an identical path (`/Users/pimbongaerts/Dropbox/Zotero`) to store attachments on all devices, and by using this path in *Custom Location* of the *General Settings* of Zotfile, and as *Base directory* in the *Files and Folders* settings of the *Advanced* Zotero preferences. Additional settings include changing *automatically rename new attachments* to *always* in the Zotfile settings and unchecking the two options under *File Syncing* in the Zotero preferences (to avoid using Zotero's storage to sync attachments.
